# simple-ts-pwa
This repository contains my beginnings in building PWA on TypeScript.

For generate ServiceWorker and build app, run `npm run build` (in production mode) or `npm run build:dev` (in development mode).

For run development server run `npm run serve`.

> Note: If you would like to run PWA for learning, using http for localhost will be fine,
but if you want to serve not on localhost, you shoud use https.
